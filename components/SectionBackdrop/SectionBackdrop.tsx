/**
 * Full-bleed scenic background for a section.
 *
 * The image covers the section and a gradient overlay sits between it and the
 * text. The overlay is `var(--overlay)`, which the parent section flips between
 * the neutral and crimson-tinted version through `.section--crisis` — so the
 * before/after palette lives entirely in the tokens file.
 *
 * Inside a regular content section the backdrop is a sticky, viewport-sized
 * stage: the image holds still while that section's content scrolls over it and
 * the next section's backdrop replaces it at the section boundary. The Footer
 * and other excluded sections keep the plain absolute fill. See
 * SectionBackdrop.css.
 *
 * The image is atmospheric rather than informational, so it is hidden from
 * assistive tech.
